    <h2>Abstraction Cellular Automata</h2>
    <p>
      I implemented automated composition with abstraction. By abstraction, I mean that the player does not have to
      worry about what is going on with the webAudio components. Factors that determine some components such as pitch
      and speed are hidden to the users, and they are unable to manually set it. By playing the game, they choose what
      sound they are playing. </p>

    <p>
      Using "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.1.9/lib/p5.js", I created cellular
      automata- Game of Life. One can click several cells on a 2d matrix and click play to generate sound. The sound
      changes as the cells live/die.

    </p>
    <p>
      Rule of the game:
    <ul>
      -A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives to the next round.</ul>
    <ul>
      -A live cell with 4 or more neighbors dies of overpopulation.</ul>
    <ul>
      -A live cell with 1 or 0 neighbors dies of isolation.</ul>
    <ul>
      -An empty cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes a live cell in the next round.</ul>

    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
      Specifications of the sound effect:
    <ul>
      -Waveform: When a cell reaches a wall, a specific waveform is added to list of potential waveform to be set.</ul>
    <ul>
      -FM Synthesis: change pitch by altering modulator frequency and gain value- they are proportional to current alive
      cells. </ul>
    <ul>
      -Speed: with alive/total cell ratio, change both the speed of sound and game. </ul>
    <ul>
      -Randomness: using row as i and column as j, when (i+j)%3 equals to 0 or 1, play an oscillator with specific
      frequency determined by i and j.</ul>
    <ul>
      -Game over: when all cells die, a specific sound created with additive synthesis is played. Using
      setTargetAtTime(0, audioCtx.currentTime, 0.8), create dramatic, long lasting sound effect</ul>

    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In addition, I added an oscilloscope using webAudio analyser. Setting its FFT frequency domain as 512, so that the
      graph is not too squished. Player can view the visual of the sound that the game is creating at the moment they
      click the "view oscilloscope" button, as the game pauses and same sound effect is played when viewing the
      oscilloscope.
    </p>


    <p>
      Combining visual components with sound was very satisfying and interesting- rather than letting sound control the
      visuals like we did in class, in this project my initial selection of cells affected the sound output.
